TILE TYPES:
    # : wall = immovable and unaccesable
    . : floor 
    + : coins = pickup
    f : fountain = interactable?
    t : teleporter
    s : secret door 
    e : stairs down = exit
    u : stairs up = spawn (0 = rendered as floor (for level trans))
    p : pressure plate = activates something
    x : trap = damages player
    k : key = opens something
    d : door (1 = closed, 0 = open)
    l : lever  
    r : rat spawn

    
    tile format:
    [type][connectionID][initial state]
    connectionID determines which tiles can communicate which each other
    using conn-IDs, it is easy to initialize activation and deactivation of traps, secret doors etc
    to create a spawn, use u, to render it as a floor (for room transistion or whatever), use state = 0
    
    exit format:
    %exit%:
        (posX, posY)-(next_levelID)-(next_level_pos)
    
    always end the level with "%%%" BELOW THE EXITS DECLARATION

    special formats:
        keys: [k][color][state (no effect)]
        doors: [d][color][initial_state (normally 0 too close)]
        fountains: [f][effect][1 (to keep track if the fountain has been used already)]
            effects are: 
                r,g,b to drop a key of the same color on a random free tile (random scatter)
                h to drop a healing potion
                d to do 1 damage
                p to teleport the player to a random exit in the same room --> next room
                z to randomly do anything (except keys) (30/30/30/10 nothing)
